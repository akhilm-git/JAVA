//Inheritance is the property by which a class can inherit the properties of another class
//there are 4 types of inheritance supported by JAVA which are single,multiple,multilevel and hybrid inheritance
//class whose properties are inherited is called parent/base class 
//class who inherits properties is called derived/child class

    }
}
class Triangle extends Shape{      //child class
    public void area(int b,int h){
        System.out.println(1/2*b*h);
    }
}
class Equilateraltriangle extends Triangle{
    public void area(int b,int h){
