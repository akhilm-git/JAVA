//access specifier are the keywords which help in data hiding i.e. Abstraction
//In java there are 4 access specifiers which are Public,private.protected and default
//Data Members declared as public can be accessed throughout the program 
//Data Members declared as private can be accessed from only within the scope of that class in which it is declared
//Data Members declared as protected can be accessed within the scope of that class in which it is declared and also by the child class

class Account{
    public String name;
    protected String email;
    private String password;
    
    //getter & setter are functions used to initialize private data members 
    
    public String getpassword(){
        return this.password;
    }
    public void setpassword(String pass){
        this.password=pass;
    }
}
    public class Bank{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        Account a1=new Account();
        a1.name="Akhil";
        a1.email="akhil230mishra@gmail.com";
        a1.setpassword("abcd");
        System.out.println(a1.getpassword());
        
    }
